## Rules
### Don't edit (or view) anything in the "Secret" folder.
### Don't break start.java by editing above/below the "do not edit" comments.
### VSCode is recommended. I had some trouble getting this to work on IntelliJ without the IDE giving some solutions away.
Also, IntelliJ doesn't have a good way to clear the terminal, so I had to just spam newlines to ensure compatibility.

## Getting Started
Run start.java. No compilation should be necessary.

## Special Rules For Specific People
