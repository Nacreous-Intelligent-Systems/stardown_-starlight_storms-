this line can be safely skipped, it doesn't contain the scary character!!!
0>Crow Patrol, report.
1>There was a group of humans near Ms. Kagiyama's residence.
1>Ms. Kagiyama chased them out of the forest before they could get hurt.
0>A group of humans from the Outside World? 
0>Wasn't there a deal that Youkai Mountain was off-limits?
1>Ms. Kagiyama did not recognize their clothing style, so they're probably not from Gensokyo.
0>Don't worry about it. I'll ask around the village next time I have a break.
0>It's nice to finally be allowed to leave the Mountain.

2>Captain! 
0>Rendevous was 5 minutes ago. Where were you?
2>There was another weather issue along the old path to the Moriya Shrine.
2>There wasn't anyone around, however.
0>That is concerning. What else did you find?
2>Something that resembled a tower from the Outside World.
0>This is getting out of hand.
0>If you're open later today, I'd like you to come with me and show the Great Tengu where this tower is.
2>Yes, but that's not the important part.
2>The weather issue appeared to be caused by the tower.
0>Instead of later today, I think we need to talk to the Great Tengu right now.
0>Fly ahead to the Nine Heavens Waterfall and let them know that I'll be out for a while.
0>Meet me at the Great Tengu's office in 45.
