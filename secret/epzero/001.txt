0>The Great Tengu Iizunamaru requests your presence in her office.
1>I feel honored.
0>She only asked because she knew that you'd be recording everything anyways, 
0>and she simply wanted to make it official.
0>Don't take it personally.

1>I, pure and honest Shameimaru, would do nothing of the sort without prior approval.
0>So, can you explain how you report on the recent rule changes so quickly?
1>The Great Tengu publishes the updated rules on the first of every month.
0>This newspaper is dated on the 30th, however. 
0>How did you get them a day early?
1>I must've simply mistyped the date.
1>It's always hectic at that time of year.
0>I seem to remember differently.

1>Anyways, did Iizunamaru request me at a specific time?
0>It appears it slipped my mind. 
0>She requested your presence at 8:05, which appears to be in one minute.
