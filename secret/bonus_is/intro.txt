I really want to make a 'What Shall I Be? The Exciting Game of the Consequences of Your Actions!' joke, even though I know -1 people will get it.
Bit #1: I'm late.
(oh also this is implied to be Yukari speaking)
0>My, my.
0>It seems we are quite...
0>                     ...fashionably late.
0>                                         
0>Well, late is indeed better than never.
(Yukari starts going off-script)
0>I was intending to stall for a class period so that the seniors could join the post-concert celebration,
0>But it seems that we had some...
0>                             ...delays with our communication.
0>So now everyone gets to enjoy an extra 'concert'!
0>Welcome to Orchestra's (late) April Fool's Event:
0>What Shall I Be? ~ The Exciting Game of the Consequences of Your Actions!
0>Or, WSIB ~ TEGotCoYA for short!

(Ran has to reel her back in.)
1>Yukari, this wasn't the intro that we agreed upon.
1>This is the (late) April Fool's Event:
1>Illusionary Sights!
(Ran tries to clear up the issue.)
1>And for the record, this isn't any sort of retaliation or anything.
1>We just didn't expect the seniors to actually be here today.

2>No, no, Ran. This *IS* retaliation.
2>For NyrÃ©li not responding to her email for EIGHT MONTHS.
2>And for being two months late to APRIL FOOLS DAY.

3>Yukari, you should know enough about being late already.
3>You still haven't repaired the barrier to the Netherworld.

2>I'll get it done soon.
2>Besides, it's more interesting this way.

3>You've said you'll "get it done soon" for the past 22 years.

2>That isn't important. Ran, please end the recording.
